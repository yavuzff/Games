STORY_CHALLENGES=['The party stands before a cavern in the heights of the Mountains of Mourn; the rumoured lair of the Dragon King.\nA foul stench issues from the opening. A sudden rumble from above warns the party of a rock fall. Quickly the party dash forward into the opening.\nThree of the party get in, however, the last one to dash in risks being hit by falling rocks (Agility Challenge rating 10).', 'The cavern slopes down steeply. From above water drips constantly. The way is treacherous.\nOne by one the characters make their way cautiously down the slope; each one wary that the slightest misstep could cause a dangerous fall.\nSuddenly one of the party loses their balance (Agility Challenge rating 12).', 'The slope eventually levels out into a wide cave, its ceiling lost in darkness.\nThe air is foetid and foul. Gnawed upon bones completely cover the floor.\nThe party pick their way carefully across the bone-pile hoping that they donâ€™t step onto anything dangerous (Luck Challenge rating 12).', 'Suddenly there is a terrifying roar.\nA blood-maddened Mountain Troll charges out of a side passage and attacks (Strength Challenge rating 14).', 'As the party continues to walk through the caverns, a hissing sound is heard. It is a snake and it has bitten one of the party members! The bite may be poisonous. (Luck rating ???)', 'A horde of bats start dashing towards you. You have to act fast and destroy them before they reach you. (Magic Rating 14)', "The party make their way through a tunnel into a room. However, they don't realise the flying arrow coming at them from the other side of the door.(Agility rating 18)", 'The room is full of skulls and bones of those who failed to kill or even find the Dragon King. There seems no hope as you approach a stone door that is locked. (Strength rating 16)', "The smell throughout the caverns get even more nasty. Your party can feel that they are close to the Dragon King.\nA tauren, who is too strong to fight with a sword, jumps above you and shouts 'You are just more meat for the king!' (Magic rating 17) ", 'This is it. It is the last dungeon before the Dragon King. A series of boulders start to fall from the ceiling onto the party. (Agility rating 16) ']
STORY_SUCCESS=['At the last second X avoids the falling rocks and enters the cavern.', 'X manages to stay still and continues to follow the party.', 'X steps on a piece of skull, but keeps on going without facing any danger.', 'X destroys the troll by finishing it off by slicing its head.', "The bite wasn't posionous! You continue to walk through the caverns.", 'X uses their wand in the nick of time and all of the bats disappear.', 'X jumps to the side as the arrow goes between their legs, into the door.', 'X lifts the stone up and manages to put a boulder under the opening. The party crawls along the foul ground.', "The tauren attempts to dash towards X, but X's magical powers cause it to dash towards the wall at full speed.", "Amazingly, X bounces from side to side to avoid the pieces of rocks falling down on the party. An opening can be seen which will lead the party to the Dragon King's treasure."]
STORY_DEFEAT=['One of the rocks fall on the leg of X.', 'X slips, leg going out from under and slides down into the darkness bouncing off protruding, jagged rocks.', 'The floor gives way beneath X revealing a spiked pit. X falls in.', 'The troll defeats X in the fight, but then accidentally falls into a spiked trap.', 'X starts seeing hallucinations and loses their balance. The bite was indeed poisonous...', "X was to late to act on their wand and as a result is attacked by the bats. There is now blood on X's face.", 'X jumps to the side, but is too late and the arrow pierces through their right foot. Fortunately, your party manages to get rid of the arrow and prevent blood loss.', 'X bashes their shoulder into the door, which ends up poorly with a half-broken arm. X realizes that there was a lever to the side of the door...', "The tauren dashes into X with its dagger in its hand and manages to stab X's arm right before the spell is said. The tauren still dies due to an unknown power.", "X acts too slowly as a giant boulder drops down from the ceiling. It misses X but a smaller piece smashes into X's stomach. An opening to the Dragon King's layer can be seen..."]
